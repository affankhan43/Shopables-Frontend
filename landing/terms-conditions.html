              <b>Subscription</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              1.1 If you wish to purchase a subscription plan made available
              through the Service (“Purchase”), you will be asked to supply
              certain information relevant to your Purchase including, a credit
              card number and the expiration date of your credit card or your
              Paypal account details. Shopables uses Paddle as its payment
              gateway.
              <br /><br />
              1.2 You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right
              to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection
              with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us
              is true, correct and complete.
              <br /><br />
              1.3 By submitting such information, you grant us the right to
              provide the information to Paddle for purposes of facilitating the
              completion of Purchases.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Paddle</strong>
              <br /><br />
              2.1 To process payments securely and efficiently, Shopables uses a
              3rd party payment platform – Paddle. Shopables uses the Paddle’s
              API to process credit card transactions for Shopables subscription
              purchases.
              <br /><br />
              2.2 By using Shopables and agreeing to these Terms of Service, You
              also agree to be bound by Paddle’s Terms of Service.
              <br /><br />
              2.3 You expressly understand and agree that all payments and
              monetary transactions are handled by Paddle. You agree that
              Shopables shall not be liable for any issues regarding financial
              and monetary transactions between You and Paddle.
              <br /><br />
              2.4 Shopables is not liable for loss or damage from errant or
              invalid transactions processed with Your Paddle account. This
              includes transactions that were not processed due to a network
              communication error, or any other reason. Where there is an issue,
              Shopables customer support will work hard to rectify any issues.
              But where there is no opportunity for Shopables to resolve issues
              relating to your payment with Paddle, the issue will remain
              between you and Paddle to resolve.
              <br /><br />
              2.5 You understand that Shopables uses the Paddle API to run the
              Service and that the Paddle API is subject to change at any time
              and such changes may adversely affect Shopables’s service. You
              understand and agree to not hold Shopables liable for any adverse
              effects (whether intentional or unintentional) on the part of
              Paddle may cause to Your Paddle account, Your Shopables account,
              or Your business.
              <br /><br />
              2.6 You must not process stolen credit cards, or unauthorized
              credit cards through Paddle and/or Your Shopables account.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Annual Subscription Cancellation</strong>
              <br /><br />
              3.1 If you purchase an annual subscription and subsequently cancel
              an annual subscription before the year has finished, you will not
              receive a pro-rata refund on the time remaining for your annual
              subscription. You can only receive a refund if you cancel within
              15 days of your subscription start date. When a subscription is
              cancelled, the account will be operational until the subscription
              period has finished.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Unrenewed Subscriptions</strong>
              <br /><br />
              4.1 If a subscription package has been purchased, but payment
              cancelled or payment details not updated, your account will be
              suspended until such a time as a new subscription is activated. We
              will not be liable to store your content past 6 months of your
              account being suspended.
              <strong>Cancellation</strong>
              <br /><br />
              You are solely responsible for properly canceling your Account. To
              do so, go to your account - Account Deletion. Any cancellation of
              your Account will result in the deactivation or deletion of your
              Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and
              relinquishment of all Content in your Account. This information
              cannot be recovered from Shopables once your account is canceled.
              Please be aware that Shopables may for a time retain residual
              information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database.
              We will make reasonable commercial efforts to delete your
              information as soon as possible after you communicate that
              intention to us. Cancellations will take effect at the end of your
              current service period. Upon the commencement of a new service
              period, the Shopables will terminate without additional notice,
              and you will not be charged for any subsequent service periods.
              You will not be provided any refunds for unused time on your
              service period.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Modifications to the Shopables Site and Prices</strong>
              <br /><br />
              Shopables reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
              modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Shopables
              Site (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
              <br /><br />
              Prices of all Shopables plans, including but not limited to
              monthly subscription plan fees to the Shopables Site, are subject
              to change.
              <br /><br />
              Shopables shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
              modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the
              Shopables Services.
              <br /><br />
              We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify,
              add to, supplement or delete any portion of these Terms of Service
              at any time, effective with or without prior notice; provided,
              however, that we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with
              notification of any material changes (as determined in our sole
              discretion) by email.
              <br /><br />
              If any future changes to these Terms of Service are unacceptable
              to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance, you must
              immediately stop using the Shopables Service. Your continued use
              of the Shopables Service following any revision to this Agreement
              constitutes your complete acceptance of any and all such changes.
              Any new features that augment or enhance the current Shopables
              Service, including the release of new tools and resources, will be
              subject to these Terms of Service.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Indemnification</strong>
              <br /><br />
              You agree to indemnify and hold Shopables, its parents,
              subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, partners and employees,
              harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys'
